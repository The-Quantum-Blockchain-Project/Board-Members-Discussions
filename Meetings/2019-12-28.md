## ARAPUCA OS

### Quorum

- __DOOMS__
- __CZPNK__

### Topic List

- OS creation
  - Unix based
  - kernel mod for native interface w/ quantum logic gate (QASM)
    - Main quantum operations processing abstraction point 
  - UI / streamlined desktop manager based on `mercury os` ([link1](https://www.mercuryos.com), [link2](https://link.medium.com/ufj96D5bN2)) interface proposed creation
  - KISS principle-based
  - Auto health-checks that restart system in case of crash
  - 2 distribution types:
    - alo (core + quantum related kernels)
    - alobahia (all modules + ui)
  - Question marks:
    - Do it modularly (using kernelmods or internal packages)
    - UEFI x BIOS
    - maintain [FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) or create a new more dynamic fs

- Shell / Python module creation for interaction/management of the logic gates interface
  - create functions or submodules do handle the abstraction through the kernel mod
    - direct interaction w/ qubit needed? for unit testing perhaps?


- Hardware 
  - Rasppi 4 (1 or n-cluster)
